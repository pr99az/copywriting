|-----|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | **Scarcity & Urgency**           | Limited supply/time cues trigger FOMO.                                              | Countdown timers, “only X left,” expiring bonuses.                                    | “Cart closes in 2 h 14 m—claim your kit now.”                      |

| 3   | **Authority Bias**               | Expert endorsement short-circuits doubt.                                            | Credentials, awards, academic data.                                                   | “Clinically tested at MIT.”                                        |
| 4   | **Loss Aversion**                | Avoiding loss feels twice as good as a gain.                                        | “Stop wasting…,” price-lock deadlines.                                                | “Keep an extra £987 a year.”                                       |

| 13  | **Liking & Familiarity**         | We say yes to brands we like or resemble.                                           | Relatable voice, founder back-story.                                                  | “Built by two mums sick of sticky lunchboxes.”                     |
| 14  | **Self-Reference / Personalisation** | “Me-tied” info sticks harder.                                                   | Name/geo insertion, “Because you bought…”.                                            | “Alex, your desk setup is missing one thing.”                      |
| 15  | **Decoy Effect**                 | A weak third option nudges toward target.                                           | Add a “middle” plan that’s inferior.                                                  | “Basic £19, Pro £49. **Elite £59** (3× features).”                 |
| 16  | **Pattern Interrupt**            | Breaking expectation resets attention.                                              | Unexpected visuals, abrupt lines.                                                     | “Stop. Scroll. (Your inbox will thank you.)”                       |

| 18  | **Priming**                      | Subtle cues shape later choices.                                                    | Mood imagery, headline-to-CTA echo.                                                   | Headline: “Imagine inbox zero.” Button: “Enter calm mode.”         |
| 19  | **Framing (Gain vs Loss)**       | Identical facts feel different by lens.                                             | A/B “save £600” vs “stop losing £600.”                                                | “Gain two free weekends a month—automate payroll.”                 |
