| #  | Concept | Why it Moves People | Copywriter’s Playbook | Micro-Example |  |  |
| -- | ------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | -- | -- |
| 1 | **Scarcity & Urgency** | Limited supply/time cues trigger FOMO. | Countdown timers, “only X left,” expiring bonuses. | “Cart closes in 2 h 14 m—claim your kit now.” | | |
| 2 | **Social Proof** | We copy the crowd when uncertain. | Star ratings, “Join 128 k pros,” testimonials. | “4.8★ from 3,912 verified creatives.” | | |
| 3 | **Authority Bias** | Expert endorsement short-circuits doubt. | Credentials, awards, academic data. | “Clinically tested at MIT.” | | |
| 4 | **Loss Aversion** | Avoiding loss feels twice as good as a gain. | “Stop wasting…,” price-lock deadlines. | “Keep an extra £987 a year.” | | |
| 5 | **Commitment & Consistency** | A small “yes” breeds bigger yeses. | Free quiz, pledge button. | “Take the 60-second carbon pledge.” | | |
| 6 | **Anchoring** | First number sets a comparison yard-stick. | MSRP before sale, premium plan first. | “Consultants charge £5 k—our kit is £79.” | | |
| 7 | **Contrast Principle** | Side-by-side options sharpen perception. | Gold/Silver/Bronze tiers, before-after. | “Old app: 17 clicks. Ours: 2.” | | |
| 8 | **Curiosity Gap** | Unresolved questions demand closure. | Teaser subject lines, open loops. | “The one ritual millionaires swear by (not meditation).” | | |
| 9 | **Story Transportation** | Narrative lets readers *feel* outcomes. | Hero + conflict + stakes. | “Melissa went from eviction notice to Superhost in 90 days.” | | |
| 10 | **Reciprocity** | We repay when given value first. | Free cheat-sheets, bonuses. | “Your free Lightroom presets—no opt-in.” | | |
| 11 | **Endowment Effect** | We over-value what feels like ours. | Full-feature trials, interactive builders. | “Your custom logo mock-ups are waiting.” | | |
| 12 | **Zeigarnik Effect** | Unfinished tasks nag us to completion. | Progress bars, “Step 1 of 3.” | “You’re 70 % to Elite—finish in 2 clicks.” | | |
| 13 | **Liking & Familiarity** | We say yes to brands we like or resemble. | Relatable voice, founder back-story. | “Built by two mums sick of sticky lunchboxes.” | | |
| 14 | **Self-Reference / Personalisation** | “Me-tied” info sticks harder. | Name/geo insertion, “Because you bought…”. | “Alex, your desk setup is missing one thing.” | | |
| 15 | **Decoy Effect** | A weak third option nudges toward target. | Add a “middle” plan that’s inferior. | “Basic £19, Pro £49. **Elite £59** (3× features).” | | |
| 16 | **Pattern Interrupt** | Breaking expectation resets attention. | Unexpected visuals, abrupt lines. | “Stop. Scroll. (Your inbox will thank you.)” | | |
| 17 | **Temporal Discounting** | We favour sooner-smaller wins. | Instant downloads, same-day shipping. | “Start streaming your course in 90 seconds.” | | |
| 18 | **Priming** | Subtle cues shape later choices. | Mood imagery, headline-to-CTA echo. | Headline: “Imagine inbox zero.” Button: “Enter calm mode.” | | |
| 19 | **Framing (Gain vs Loss)** | Identical facts feel different by lens. | A/B “save £600” vs “stop losing £600.” | “Gain two free weekends a month—automate payroll.” | | |
| 20 | **Rhyme-as-Reason Effect** | Rhymes *sound* truer, stickier. | Taglines, mnemonic CTAs. | “Fit bit, never quit.” | | |
| 21 | **Ben Franklin Effect** | We grow fond of those we do favours for. | Ask micro-help before pitch (survey, vote). | “Lend us your 30-second insight—shape tomorrow’s roadmap.” | | |
| 22 | **Pratfall Effect** | A tiny flaw makes you more relatable. | Admit a minor imperfection → trust spike. | “Yep, our packaging was ugly—so we rebuilt it from scratch.” | | |
| 23 | **Peak-End Rule** | We judge experiences by peaks & finale. | Stage a wow moment + strong close. | “Final checkout screen drops a surprise £10 gift card.” | | |
| 24 | **IKEA Effect** | People love what they help create. | Custom-build wizards, choose-your-own bundles. | “Drag tiles to design *your* dream keyboard—save as soon as you’re happy.” | | |
| 25 | **Fresh-Start Effect** | Temporal landmarks reset motivation. | Launch on Mondays, birthdays, new quarters. | “This Friday marks Q3—time your fitness reboot.” | | |
| 26 | **Enemy Effect (Tribal Trigger)** | A common foe unites & energises. | “Old-guard software,” “paper-chasing bureaucracy.” | “Stop donating margin to GrinderCorp—own your shop with us.” | | |
| 27 | **Self-Herding** | Past choices steer future ones (“I’m a buyer”). | Reinforce identity immediately post-purchase. | “Welcome, Trailblazer! Badge unlocked after your first lesson.” | | |
| 28 | **Anti-Authority (Wrongology)** | Openly noting weaknesses boosts credibility. | “Here’s where we still fall short…” section. | “We’re not perfect: Android dark-mode lands next month—here’s the roadmap.” | | |
| 29 | **Desirable Difficulty** | A tiny hurdle increases perceived value. | Short quiz before unlock, secret password. | “Answer 3 quick questions to reveal Insider pricing.” | | |
| 30 | **Trojan-Horse Content** | Deliver unexpected payoff beyond headline promise. | Subject teases X, body gifts X + bonus Y. | “Find your focus - guide *and* free Pomodoro timer." | | |
| 31 | **Baader-Meinhof Frequency Spike** | After noticing a thing, we “see it everywhere,” boosting salience. | Retarget ads, podcast mentions, inbox P.S. right after first click. | “Notice how every second founder on LinkedIn is citing ‘pricing power’? That’s our playbook in action.” | | |
| 32 | **Enclothed Cognition Cue** | Mentally “wearing” an item shifts self-perception & behaviour. | AR try-ons, name-stamped mock-ups, POV video. | “Slide this watch onto your wrist in 3-D—hear boardroom decisions click louder.” | | |
| 33 | **Inoculation Pitch** | Mild counter-argument immunises against stronger objections. | “You might think X… here’s why that’s half-true.” | “Sure, AI notes look generic—*if* you haven’t trained the prompts. Watch us weaponise prose into deal-closing gold.” | | |
| 34 | **Future-Nostalgia Frame** | We crave experiences we’ll enjoy remembering later. | Paint the future memory (photos, legend retold). | “Picture 2035: your daughter pausing at the day you conquered Kilimanjaro—because you started training tonight.” | | |
| 35 | **Processing-Fluency Glow** | Effortless reading feels truer and safer. | Short sentences, rhyme, concrete verbs, kill jargon. | “Skip the guesswork, click the shortcut, own the win.” | | |
| 36 | **Door-In-The-Face Contrast** | Big first ask makes the real ask feel tiny. | Offer audacious package, then down-sell. | “Hire us for a year (£120k)… or test one sprint for the price of a city break.” | | |
| 37 | **Cross-Modal Anchor** | Sensory metaphor from another sense makes abstract benefits tangible. | “Workflow feels like warm vinyl,” “pricing lands like a soft pillow.” | “Launching the app is like cracking a cold can on a July afternoon—instant fizz, zero friction.” | | |
| 38 | **Surrogate-Self Lens** | Advising a friend sidesteps our own self-doubt. | Ask prospect to advise a friend, then apply to self. | “If your best friend’s side-hustle was stuck at £2 k/mo, would you tell her to wait—or grab the accelerator?” | | |
| 39 | **Spacing-Effect Drip** | Memory locks in when exposures are spaced. | Rhythm launch emails (Day 0, 2, 6…), each touch new angle. | “Day-6 ping: one fresh use-case—unlock before Friday’s deadline.” | | |
| 40 | **Single-Option Aversion Flip** | One solitary choice can stall action; adding a decoy nudges commitment. | Add “Not today—remind me” next to Yes. | Buttons: **A)** “Start free trial” **B)** “Ask me in a month (miss launch perks)”. | | |
| 41 | **Goal-Gradient Surge** | Motivation spikes near a finish line—even a fake one. | Show 80 % badge, 3-question checkout. | “You’re 2 lessons from ‘Fluent’—hit play now.” | | |
| 42 | **Operational Transparency** | Trust climbs when we glimpse backstage work. | Live prep cams, code commits, timestamped roast logs. | “Roaster hit 196 °C at 04:12 — your beans ship at noon.” | | |
| 43 | **Ulysses Pact Prompt** | Pre-commitments help intentions stick. | “Lock focus,” auto-ship, savings vault toggles. | “Tick ‘Focus Mode’ and we’ll mute socials during your sprint.” | | |
| 44 | **Concrete-Unit Cascade** | Abstract numbers feel bigger when chunked into vivid units. | Swap 1 GB → 250 songs, £3/day → one flat white. | “One bus ticket a week powers your cloud backups all year.” | | |
| 45 | **Self-Signalling Loop** | Purchases broadcast identity to *ourselves*. | Frame buying as proof of character. | “Join the guild of founders who *ship*—badge on first commit.” | | |
| 46 | **Diderot Effect Harness** | One buy sparks a chain of complementary buys. | Bundled add-ons, matching themes. | “Your new fountain pen deserves the parchment journal—save 15 % when paired.” | | |
| 47 | **Truth-Bias Disruptor** | We default to believing unless cued to doubt. | State bold claim then verify instantly. | “Ships tomorrow. Yes, really—orders before 3 p.m. print straight to the belt.” | | |
| 48 | **Affective Forecast Flip** | People mis-predict future feelings—guide them. | Ask to imagine post-purchase emotion. | “Friday night, laptop closed, taxes done—because TurboBot ran the numbers.” | | |
| 49 | **Anti-Mimetic Magnet** | We notice rule-breakers. | Vertical testimonials, blank hero, silent autoplay. | “Everything else is noise → enter.” | | |
| 50 | **Effort-Justification Trigger** | Small pre-purchase effort inflates value. | Mini quiz, configurator, crowd-vote gate. | “Answer 4 sliders to sculpt *your* skincare formula—unlock at checkout.” | | |
| 51 | **Variable-Reward Loop** | Unpredictable pay-offs spike dopamine. | Easter eggs, spin wheels, rotating bonuses. | “Open today’s lesson—1 in 5 unlocks a secret masterclass.” | | |
| 52 | **Pique Technique** | Quirky specifics snap attention. | Odd numerals, 212-second audit. | “Can I borrow 18 p of your attention for one quick graph?” | | |
| 53 | **Pain-of-Paying Dampener** | Frictionless or delayed pay dulls loss pain. | 1-click, Apple Pay, bill next month. | “Tap twice—first month on the house, next one on auto.” | | |
| 54 | **Counterfactual Mirror** | Imagining the “bad timeline” intensifies action. | Forked-path story, twin images. | “If you’d invested £5/day last January, you’d be on a beach—start the *other* timeline today.” | | |
| 55 | **Novelty Heuristic** | Brain over-weights “new & shiny.” | Never-seen comparison, beta feature. | “Meet the first to-do list that grows *wings* when you fall behind.” | | |
| 56 | **Dynamic Norms Effect** | People follow *trends*, not static norms. | Phrase proof as movement gaining speed. | “Last month, 9,314 designers switched—join early.” | | |
| 57 | **Illusory Truth Amplifier** | Repetition quietly boosts truthiness. | Repeat core promise verbatim across assets. | “Sleep deeper. Wake clearer.”—hero, quote, exit-pop. | | |
| 58 | **Default Nudge** | We stick with pre-selected options. | Pre-check annual plan, mark “recommended.” | “✅ Annual plan (2 months free, cancel anytime).” | | |
| 59 | **Operant Framing** | The action itself triggers a micro-reward. | Confetti burst, haptic buzz, “cha-ching” sound. | “Nice click—credit applied!” | | |
| 60 | **Parasocial Whisper** | Human conversational tone builds one-sided friendship. | Voice-note emails, “typing…” GIFs, founder asides. | “Hey—it’s Jade. Just brewed an espresso and thought of a tweak for your funnel…” | | |
